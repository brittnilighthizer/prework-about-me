      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a traveller, bottle service manager and dog-mom.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally from Gilbert, Arizona (East Valley) I moved to DFW in 2008. I've been living in Dallas for 6 years.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy travelling, especially in the mountains with my siberian husky, Vira</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to open my laptop from any zip code or continent, and generate an income to further support my main goal of freedom. I tend to like careers that are competitive, that allow my perfectionism to play, but also allow for creativity and freedom.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Uptown, Dallas, TX</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Moving forward, the skill of programming seems to be vital to success as our economy and cultures evolve. I also taught myself HTML / CSS when I was 14 making MySpace layouts an didn't even realize thats what they were. Man, wish someone would have told me that back then lol.</p>
